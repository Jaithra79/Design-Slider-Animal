                        The Alaska Moose (*Alces alces gigas*), a subspecies of moose found primarily in Alaska and parts of Canada. It is the largest subspecies of moose, with adult males, or bulls, reaching up to 1,800 pounds and standing over 6 feet tall at the shoulder. This subspecies is adapted to the harsh Alaskan climate, featuring thick fur and long legs for navigating deep snow. Moose are herbivores and primarily feed on willow, birch, aspen twigs, and aquatic vegetation. During the mating season, bulls grow massive antlers, which can span up to 6 feet and are shed annually after the rut. Alaska moose are essential to the local ecosystem and are a critical food source for predators such as wolves and bears.

                    <div class="des">
                        The African forest elephant (*Loxodonta cyclotis*) is a smaller species of elephant native to the dense rainforests of Central and West Africa. Distinguished by their straighter, downward-pointing tusks and rounder ears, they are smaller than their savanna counterparts. These elephants play a vital role in forest ecology by dispersing seeds through their dung, promoting biodiversity. They are typically more elusive and shy, making them harder to study. Unfortunately, they are critically endangered due to habitat destruction and poaching for their ivory. African forest elephants live in small family groups, often led by a matriarch, and communicate using low-frequency sounds.

                    The leopard (*Panthera pardus*) is a powerful and agile big cat native to Africa and parts of Asia. Known for its distinctive spotted coat, it has rosettes that help it blend seamlessly into its environment for camouflage. Leopards are highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of habitats including savannas, forests, mountains, and even urban outskirts. They are solitary animals and are primarily nocturnal hunters, preying on a wide range of animals such as deer, monkeys, and birds. Leopards are incredibly strong climbers and often haul their prey into trees to protect it from scavengers. Despite their adaptability, leopards face threats from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflicts. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this elusive and majestic predator in the wild.
